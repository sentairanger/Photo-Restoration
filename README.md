# Photo-Restoration
This project restores old black and white photos using colorization and utilizes the OpenVINO toolkit and the Open Model Zoo

## Getting Started

First, you must install OpenVINO on your own system. Follow this [link](https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/get-started/install-openvino.html?VERSION=v_2024_1_0&OP_SYSTEM=LINUX&DISTRIBUTION=ARCHIVE).This project will work on any PC or Mac, and any single board computer that uses the x86 Architecture. Also use the `installation.sh` to download and then convert the models to IR format. Next, simply run the app on the terminal with `python3 app.py` and make sure you go to `localhost:5000` on any browser. Make sure you have your own photos to test. Then press the button to colorize all the photos. Then go to the Gallery and they should appear. You can delete images if necessary or you can go to the folder and then change the name of the image.
